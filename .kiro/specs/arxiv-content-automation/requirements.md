# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ArXiv Content Automation System is designed to streamline the process of discovering, analyzing, and publishing research-based content across multiple platforms. The system will automatically pull ArXiv research papers into a database, analyze them for key insights, and generate platform-specific content (blog posts, LinkedIn posts, X posts) while maintaining contextual links to previously processed research. A human-in-the-loop approval process ensures quality control before publication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ArXiv Paper Ingestion and Analysis

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically discover, ingest, and deeply analyze new ArXiv papers, so that I have a rich knowledge base of research insights and can identify high-value content opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs its scheduled ingestion process THEN it SHALL fetch new papers from ArXiv based on predefined search criteria
2. WHEN a new paper is discovered THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including title, authors, abstract, publication date, categories, and full citation list
3. WHEN a paper is processed THEN the system SHALL store the full text content in a searchable format
4. WHEN analyzing a paper THEN the system SHALL apply a structured rubric to extract key insights including:
   - Novel frameworks or methodologies introduced
   - Key concepts and terminology definitions
   - Significant data points, metrics, or experimental results
   - Practical applications or use cases
   - Limitations or areas for future research
   - Connections to existing research areas
5. WHEN processing citations THEN the system SHALL identify highly-cited referenced papers and queue them for backfill ingestion
6. WHEN evaluating citation importance THEN the system SHALL prioritize papers with citation counts above configurable thresholds
7. WHEN backfilling cited papers THEN the system SHALL apply the same analysis rubric to maintain consistency
8. IF a paper already exists in the database THEN the system SHALL skip duplicate ingestion but update citation metrics
9. WHEN analysis fails for a paper THEN the system SHALL log the error, flag for manual review, and continue processing other papers

### Requirement 2: Structured Knowledge Extraction

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a consistent and comprehensive analysis framework applied to all papers, so that I can reliably identify valuable insights and maintain high-quality knowledge extraction across my entire database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the analysis rubric THEN the system SHALL support configurable extraction templates for different research domains
2. WHEN analyzing papers THEN the system SHALL organize them using both categorical classification and flexible tagging:

   **Primary Categories (mutually exclusive):**

   - Evidence strength: experimental, theoretical, observational, anecdotal

   **Multi-value Tags (combinable):**
   - Research domains: machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, etc.
   - Concepts: specific techniques, algorithms, or theoretical constructs mentioned
   - Methodologies: approaches or processes used or described
   - Applications: use cases, industries, or problem domains addressed
   - Innovation markers: novel, incremental, survey, reproduction, extension
   - Practical applicability: high, medium, low, theoretical-only
3. WHEN extracting key concepts THEN the system SHALL create standardized concept definitions and maintain a concept glossary
4. WHEN identifying data points THEN the system SHALL extract quantitative results, performance metrics, and statistical significance
5. WHEN processing methodologies THEN the system SHALL document step-by-step approaches and implementation details
6. WHEN analyzing limitations THEN the system SHALL identify gaps, assumptions, and areas requiring further research
7. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL assign confidence scores to each extracted insight
8. WHEN classifying paper types THEN the system SHALL distinguish between:
   - Conceptual Framework papers (introducing new theoretical models or approaches)
   - Survey/Review papers (comprehensive analysis of existing research in a domain)
   - Empirical Study papers (original experiments with data collection and analysis)
   - Case Study papers (detailed analysis of specific implementations or applications)
   - Benchmark/Comparison papers (systematic evaluation of multiple approaches)
   - Position papers (arguing for specific viewpoints or research directions)
   - Tutorial/Methodology papers (explaining how to implement or use techniques)
9. WHEN paper type is identified THEN the system SHALL apply type-specific extraction templates to capture relevant insights
10. WHEN organizing papers THEN the system SHALL support filtering and search by:
    - Single category selection (show me all "conceptual framework" papers)
    - Multiple tag combinations (show me papers tagged with both "reinforcement learning" AND "natural language processing")
    - Hierarchical browsing (domain → subdomain → specific concepts)
    - Temporal filtering (papers from last 6 months with "high" practical applicability)
11. WHEN displaying paper collections THEN the system SHALL show category distribution and tag frequency to help users understand the knowledge base composition
12. IF extraction quality falls below thresholds THEN the system SHALL flag the paper for manual expert review

### Requirement 3: Content Generation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to generate platform-specific content from research papers, so that I can efficiently create engaging posts for different audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a paper is selected for content generation THEN the system SHALL create content variants for blog, LinkedIn, and X platforms
2. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL apply platform-specific best practices for tone, length, and formatting
3. WHEN creating content THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent writing style based on configurable style guidelines
4. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL extract key insights and present them in an accessible manner
5. IF content generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 4: Contextual Linking and Cross-Referencing

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to identify connections between new papers and existing content in my database, so that I can provide rich context and build upon previous discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a new paper THEN the system SHALL analyze semantic similarity with existing papers in the database
2. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant links to previously published content based on paper type relationships (e.g., linking case studies to their underlying frameworks)
3. WHEN identifying connections THEN the system SHALL highlight related concepts, methodologies, research areas, and complementary paper types
4. WHEN suggesting links THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for relevance and specify the relationship type (builds-upon, contradicts, extends, applies, surveys)
5. WHEN linking papers THEN the system SHALL prioritize connections that create narrative coherence (e.g., framework → application → case study progression)
6. IF no relevant connections are found THEN the system SHALL proceed without cross-references

### Requirement 5: Human-in-the-Loop Approval
